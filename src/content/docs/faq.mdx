## Is VShop dead?

No. VShop is not dead. Our Discord server is still active with 14 thousand faithful Valorant players and we are happy to help with any questions about VShop. 
The development of the app has been put into maintenance-only mode. Only errors and bugs will be fixed and no new features will be added for the time being. 
If you're wondering why, you'll find the answer on [this page](https://docs.vshop.one/distribution-update).

## Why is VShop sometimes not accessible and only after an update?

Valorant and Riot Games are constantly making changes to their server and security structure. When Riot Games makes a change, we may need to make certain changes to our app code. We will try to implement these changes as soon as possible. It may also happen that the servers are not available due to an adjustment by Riot Games. We have absolutely no influence on this.  We will inform you on our Discord if this happens.

## Can I help translate the app into other languages?

We really appreciate everyone who helps us make the app easier to understand for more people. 
You can start right away on our [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/vshop/mobile/) platform. You can do this without an account.

## Why can't I see my shop in the browser anymore?

VShop is available for Android and iOS, therefore the **Web** version of VShop was been discontinued in 2023.
There are also no plans to develop a desktop app for VShop.

## Can I buy skins with VShop?

No, you are not able to buy skins in the app and this will most not change.
Valorant / Riot Games unfortunately does not offer an [API](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api) or similar to implement something like this.

## Can I get free VP, RP, ...?

No.
