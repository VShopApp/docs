### No perks after in-app donation

We offer a notification service to inform you about items in your shop as soon as they are available for purchase. This service is available to donors. 

If you donated but did not receive your perks, try the following steps:

<Steps>
1. **Wait a few minutes**
  
    Depending on your bank and currency, it may take a few minutes for your payment to process and for your perks to activate.

2. **Restart the App**

   Force quit the app through your system settings and then reopen it. This can often refresh the app’s status.

3. **Reinstall the App**

   If restarting doesn't help, uninstall the app completely and then reinstall it using the APK from [GitHub](https://github.com/VShopApp/mobile/releases).
