Your app is (completely) white after login.

<Aside>
  It could be that Riot Games Cloudflare proxy has interfered, but does not
  display an error message. Try the [Access
  Denied](/troubleshooting/access_denied) fix anyway.

<Steps>
1. **Check version**
  
    Please check that you have the newest update of VShop. You can find the newest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/VShopApp/mobile/releases).

2. **Delete app cache & storage**

   Delete the cache and storage of the app. If the problem persists, please remove all app content through your operating system. On Android devices, you can follow [this guide](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/739613/how-to-clear-app-cache-on-android.html). On iOS, it is mandatory to reinstall the app.

3. **Reinstall the App**

   If that doesn't help, uninstall the app completely and then reinstall it using the APK from [GitHub](https://github.com/VShopApp/mobile/releases).
