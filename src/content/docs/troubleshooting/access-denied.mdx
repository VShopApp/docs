You receive an `Access Denied - Error code: 1020` message after you log in.

This has nothing to do with VShop. Riot Games  use the security service [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/) for the login page they have integrated to protect themselves against bot attacks. Unfortunately, this also blocks many requests from VPN services or public DNS servers.

<Steps>
1. **Check for Updates**

   To ensure optimal performance and stability, make sure you have the latest version of VShop installed. You can find the newest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/VShopApp/mobile/releases).

2. **Test Riot Games Authentication**

   To verify if the issue lies with your Network, open the following URL in your browser:

   👉 [Riot Games Authentication](https://login.riotgames.com/)

3. **Check if Riot Games has issues**

   It is possible that this issue is a global, known problem. Please check if Riot Games has made any official announcements regarding this.

   👉 [Riot Games Status](https://status.riotgames.com/)

3. **Check DNS and VPN Settings**

   Certain DNS and VPN services can interfere with Riot Games authentication. Make sure to disable the following before proceeding:

   - DNS applications such as **Cloudflare WARP**
   - VPN services like **NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or similar**

   **VPN connections are often the primary reason for authentication failures. It is strongly recommended to disable any active VPN before attempting to connect.**
</Steps>

If none of this has helped or your home network is affected by such a blockage, make sure that you have not made any routing or special VPN settings. Some schools and public institutions use specific DNS servers that are blocked by Cloudflare.
