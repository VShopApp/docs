  In most cases this is caused because of maintenance by Riot Games. Try again
  when VALORANT is playable again. Check our [Discord](/discord) for more

### "My app loads infinitely after I log in"

The app loads infinitely. Even after a waiting time of 2 minutes & few attempts.

<Steps>
1. **Check version**
    
    Please check that you have the newest update of VShop.

2. **Check your internet connection**

   Ensure that you have an active internet connection. A slow or poor internet connection could be one of the reasons for a long loading time. Try using a different network connection if possible.

3. **Delete app cache & storage**

   Delete the cache and storage of the app. If the problem persists, please remove all app content through your operating system. On Android devices, you can follow [this guide](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/739613/how-to-clear-app-cache-on-android.html). On iOS, it is mandatory to reinstall the app.
