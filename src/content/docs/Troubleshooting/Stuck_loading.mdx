## "My app loads infinitely after I log in"

The app loads infinitely. Even after a waiting time of 2 minutes & few attempts.

## Check version
Please check that you have the newest update of VShop.

## Check your internet connection
Ensure that you have an active internet connection. A slow or poor internet connection could be one of the reasons for a long loading time. Try using a different network connection if possible.

## Try another language
Try changing the language in the app. You can do this under "Settings" in the menu.

## Delete app cache & storage 
Delete the cache and storage of the app. If the problem persists, please remove all app content through your operating system. On Android devices, you can follow [this guide](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/739613/how-to-clear-app-cache-on-android.html). On iOS, it is mandatory to reinstall the app.

If the problem still exists, please contact us on our [Discord](https://vshop.one/discord/).
