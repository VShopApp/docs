<Aside type="caution" title="Check Valorant Status">
  In most cases this is caused because of maintenance or a issue by Riot Games. Try again
  when VALORANT is playable again. Check the [Valorant Status](https://status.riotgames.com/valorant) and our [Discord](https://vshop.one/discord) for more
  information.

### The App loads infinitely

Even after a waiting time of 10 minutes and few attempts.

<Steps>
1. **Check version & Riot Games Status**
    
    Please check that you have the newest update of VShop. You can find the newest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/VShopApp/mobile/releases).
    Also, please check the [Valorant](https://status.riotgames.com/valorant) and [Riot Games](https://status.riotgames.com/) status.

2. **Check your internet connection**

   Ensure that you have an active internet connection. A slow or poor internet connection could be one of the reasons for a long loading time. Try using a different network connection if possible.

3. **Delete app cache & storage**

   Delete the cache and storage of the app. If the problem persists, please remove all app content through your operating system. On Android devices, you can follow [this guide](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/739613/how-to-clear-app-cache-on-android.html). On iOS, it is mandatory to reinstall the app.
