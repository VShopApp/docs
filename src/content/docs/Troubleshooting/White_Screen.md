Your app is (completely) white and you only have an X button in the top left corner.

## Check version
Please check that you have the newest update of VShop.

## "Access Denied"
It could be that Riot Games Cloudflare proxy has interfered, but does not display an error message. 
Try the [Access Denied](https://docs.vshop.one/Troubleshooting/Access_Denied/) fix anyway.

## Delete app cache & storage 
If the problem persists, please remove all app content through your operating system.
On Android, [try this guide](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/739613/how-to-clear-app-cache-on-android.html). On iOS, it is mandatory to reinstall the app.

If the problem still exists, please contact us on our [Discord](https://vshop.one/discord/).
