### No perks after in-app donation

If you donated but did not receive your perks, try the following steps:

<Steps>
1. **Wait a few minutes**
  
    Depending on your bank and currency, it may take a few minutes for your payment to process and for your perks to activate.

2. **Restart the App**

   Force quit the app through your system settings and then reopen it. This can often refresh the appâ€™s status.

3. **Reinstall the App**

   If restarting doesn't help, uninstall the app completely and then reinstall it using the APK from [GitHub](https://github.com/VShopApp/mobile/releases).
