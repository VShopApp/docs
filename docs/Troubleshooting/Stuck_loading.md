!!! danger "Login Issue Resolved: Download Updated Version"

    There is currently an issue that prevents login for all users. However, we have resolved this problem and you can now download the fixed version of the app from the new [Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.vasc.vshop2). We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

    For iOS users, you can participate in the beta version of VShop by joining through [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/BeOIXqDR). Please note that the public update for the app store is currently under review by Apple, and we are unable to provide an exact timeframe for when the update will be approved.

    For updates and more information regarding the situation, please refer to our [Discord server](https://vshop.one/discord).
## "My app loads infinitely after I log in"

The app loads infinitely. Even after a waiting time of 2 minutes & few attempts.

## Check version
Please check that you have the newest update of the V-Shop app.

## Check your internet connection
Ensure that you have an active internet connection. A slow or poor internet connection could be one of the reasons for a long loading time. Try using a different network connection if possible.

## Try another language
Try changing the language in the app. You can do this under "Settings" in the menu.

## Delete app cache & storage 
Delete the cache and storage of the app. If the problem persists, please remove all app content through your operating system. On Android devices, you can follow [this guide](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/739613/how-to-clear-app-cache-on-android.html). On iOS, it is mandatory to reinstall the app.
