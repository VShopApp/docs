## "My app loads infinitely after I log in"

The app loads infinitely. Even after a waiting time of 2 minutes & few attempts.

## Check version
Please check that you have the newest update of the V-Shop app.

## Check your internet connection
You need an active internet connection. One reason for a long loading time could be bad signal or internet speed. Check your Internet connection. If possible, try another network.

## Try another language
Please try to change the language in the app. You can change the language under "Settings" in the menu.

## Delete app cache & storage 
If the problem remains, please remove all app content through your operating system.
