##"Login with Facebook, Google, Apple doesn't work
Unfortunately, we cannot offer a login with third-party services at the current time. This is technically not possible. 
Login via Facebook, Google and Apple account is therefore not possible. 

To still use VShop [you can reset your password here](https://recovery.riotgames.com/en/forgot-password) and log in normally with email & password without third-party service. **Please make sure to set the correct region.**

If you have any further questions or problems, please feel free to contact us on our [Discord](https://vshop.one/discord/).
