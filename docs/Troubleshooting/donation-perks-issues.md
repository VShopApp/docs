# I have made a donation but have not received any perks

If you donated but did not receive your perks, try the following steps:

1. **Wait a few minutes:**
   - Depending on your bank and currency, it may take a few minutes for your payment to process and for your perks to activate.

2. **Restart the App:**
   - Force quit the app through your system settings and then reopen it. This can often refresh the app’s status.

3. **Reinstall the App:**
   - If restarting doesn't help, uninstall the app completely and then reinstall it using the APK from [VShop GitHub](https://github.com/VShopApp/mobile/releases).
