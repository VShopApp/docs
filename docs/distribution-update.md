# ⚠️ Distribution Update

Dear VShop community,
I've decided to stop distributing VShop through the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store effective immediately. This is a difficult decision to make, but Riot Games won't stop sending me emails and threatening me with legal action. Last week they sent a complaint to Apple and today I received a complaint about the website. I also talked to a guy who actually talked to a MARQVISION employee and was told that they don't plan to stop and will shut down apps in the future, so it's only a matter of time before the Google Play Store app will be shut down again, so I'm going to do it before they do.

In addition, I've published the entire source code to [GitHub](https://github.com/vshopapp/mobile). To be clear: **the app will continue to work** and I'll put the project into maintenance-only mode, which means I'll fix bugs and issues as best I can, but I won't necessarily add any new features. If you want to contribute, open a pull request and I will be more than happy to look at it and merge it. Downloads are now only available on GitHub for Android as an apk file.

**The Discord server will of course continue to exist and I will be as active as ever.**

Thanks for all the support, I really enjoyed making and updating VShop for this wonderful community 💖. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on our [Discord server](https://vshop.one/discord).
